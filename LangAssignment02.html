    "The Township of Thornbury was incorporated on April 23, 1833. The source of its name is somewhat controversial. Some historians claim it was inspired by the wild thorn berries that grew along the Georgian Bay shoreline. Others deduce that the settlement was named after three Thornburys from England" </div>

  "Over the years Thornbury has been home to a wide spectrum of businesses. From the Chemical Works to T.G. Idle’s Furniture store which furnished many of the distinguished homes in the area; to the Thos. W. Eastland department store where groceries were displayed on one side and dry goods on the other Keast Tailoring which is still going strong four generations later. The apple packing industry took root in Thornbury in the 1880s. In 1905 the Georgian Bay Fruit Growers Association was formed. The Mitchell family were prominent and vocal members of the group, and for years famous Mitchell-brand cider vinegar, apple juice and sauce were produced in the Thornbury processing plant."
